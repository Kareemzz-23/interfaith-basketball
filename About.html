        <p class="content-paragraph">

            truly special in Telford. Together, we thrive!

        <h4 class="content-heading">The Founder</h4>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
            Dr. Hezron started Telford Interfaith Community Basketball in 2019 as a small group that aimed to bring people from 
            different faiths, backgrounds, and cultures together. Since starting TIC Basketball, Dr. Hezron has taken it upon himself to
            provide a safe space for every single member of TIC Basketball, providing care, advice, and taking a personal interest
            in all TIC members' lives. Dr. Hezron filled the role of brother, mentor, father, and friend for all TIC members, celebrating 
            their successes and consoling them in their grief. Dr. Hezron's feat can only be described as phenomenal, and it is thanks to him that
            TIC Basketball can call themselves a family.
