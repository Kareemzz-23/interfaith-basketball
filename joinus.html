        TIC Basketball has been around since 2019, with new members showing up every session. 
        Our members always look forward to their sessions and enjoy the stress-relieving environment.
        TIC Basketball is a great way to meet new people, and adopt a fun yet non-overwhelming level
        of physical exercise.
        <br>
        TIC Basketball is an exceptional community with high diversity and outstanding values. We celebrate 
        all our members, and share their joy in many major life events, welcoming 2 newborns of our members last
        year. At TIC you will meet many people with different backgrounds, faiths, identities and cultures, sharing 
        in the fun and excitement of Basketball. We are sure that you will also find out that all TIC Basketball members
        enjoy a good laugh and friendly banter.
        <br>  
        TIC Basketball members are friendly and are happy to guide newer members through the sport. So,
        whether you are a pro hooper or looking to pick a new hobby, TIC Basketball is the place for you...and the first
        session is free.
